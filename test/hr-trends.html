                    <li data-translate="hrTrendContent1">According to Gartner, in 2024, Leader and Manager development is a major focus for HR Leaders. To increase managers effectiveness, the organisations need to lighten the responsibilities of managers by reviewing role expectations and removing process hurdles.</li>
                    <li data-translate="hrTrendContent2">Heading into 2025, HR Leaders must redefine their strategies and priorities in key areas including developing managers, create a strategic workforce planning and optimise HR technology and data analytics. Moving beyond traditional leadership seminars to foster peer connections and embed learning opportunities into daily work allows managers to build stronger leadership skills and prepare for future demands. Emerging solutions, such as generative AI, have the potential to transform HR operations by streamlining processes, improving decision making and enhancing the employee experience.</li>
